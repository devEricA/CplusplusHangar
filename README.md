# theCplusplusHangar
A simple project demonstrating my experience with C++.

# Problem
C++ is one of the most sought after languages in the job market. While I have coded in C++ before, none of my public projects are programmed in C++, and thus, recruiters cannot make a good judgement on how strong my C++ is. 

# Objective
Use C++ to create a program that displays aircraft stored in hangars. 
The specifications for the hangar and aircraft are as follows. 
- Hangar 
    - String Name
    - Array of Aircraft

- Aircraft
    - String Name
    - String Engine
    - String Manufacturer
    - Integer MaxAltitude
    - String Notes

- Jet
    - Extension of Aircraft
    - String WingShape
    - Boolean isStealth

- Helicopter
    - Extension of Aircraft
    - String rotorType 

# Definition of done
At least two hangars must be defined. One hangar must have an Aircraft and a Jet stored in it. Another hangar must have a Helicopter and a Jet stored in it. 

When the program runs, The name of the hangar must be displayed first, followed by all of the aircraft and its info. Rinse and repeat for all other hangars. 

# Additional Information
Compiled in a Linux Mint environment utilizing g++ version 9.3.0
Developed via Visual Studio Code.
